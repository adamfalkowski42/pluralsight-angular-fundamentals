Module - 3 - Video Communicating with Parent Components
    - Child Component
        - (click)="handleClickMe()"
            - function within the child component that emits an event
            - handleClickMe()
                this.eventClick.emit(this.event.name);
            - this.eventClick is an @Output() eventClick property in the child component
        - Parent component 
            - Has the child component in its template
                <event-thumbnail></event-thumbnail>
            - within this element there is an (eventClick) binding
            - this handles the event emitted from the child
            - need to create a function within the parent component to handle this event.
            - handleEventClick(data)
                - contains the data emitted by the child component event
                - in this case it is the this.event.name

Module 3 - Using Template Variables to interact with Child Component
    - #value - signifies a template Variable
    - in this example he uses #thumbnail as the template Variable
        then creates a method witin the child component called logFoo()
    - using this code: thumbnail.logFoo() you can access this variable as long as it is inside the event-thumbnail element.
        - <event-thumbnail #thumbnail></event-thumbnail>
